# Project description
This project was conducted as a part of a group effort during the final two weeks of the Bootcamp.

## Company Overview: "Prello"
Prello is a proptech company established in 2021, specializing in the sale and management of second homes. With a mission to revolutionize the second home market, Prello offers innovative options such as co-purchase or single purchase. The company provides comprehensive services, including legal support, property maintenance, Airbnb rental management, and co-owner coordination.

## Business Challenge
As Prello's operations are not nationwide, the company faces the need to identify optimal areas for deploying property hunters effectively.

## Solution Approach
To address this challenge, we devised a scoring system to rank French departments based on their desirability. Our approach involved several key steps:

1. Data Cleaning and Exploration: We conducted thorough data cleaning and normalization procedures, followed by an exploratory analysis of the relevant datasets.

2. Parameter Identification: We identified four key parameters critical for the scoring model, considering various factors that contribute to department attractiveness.

3. Investor Profiles and Weighting: We created distinct investor profiles and assigned different weights to each parameter based on the preferences of these profiles.

4. Dashboard Development: As a final step, we designed and developed an interactive dashboard, enabling convenient comparison of departments from multiple perspectives.

By implementing this solution, we aimed to provide Prello with valuable insights for identifying the most promising areas to focus their property hunting efforts.
